MarketingFirm.cs dependency injection
_____________________________________

 -Dependency injection is being used in the MarketingFirm constructor because it allows any MarketingFirm object to create either a SweepstakesStackManager or SweepstakesQueueManager. 

-This is possible because both manager's (stack and queue) inherit from the "ISweepstakesManager" interface.  

-This injection is beneficial because now the application can utilize a single MarketingFirm class instead of having a MarketingFirmStack class and a MarketingFirmQueue class. Also, it allows for extension easily to a different type of manager. As long as the manager inherits from the "ISweepstakesManager" interface.
